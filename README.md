# garageController
Controller for light, electromagnetic locks, sensors, alarm system, access controll

Here I share my plans for an garage controller board to automate stuff like the lights and also add security measures to protect my tools from theft.


My garage is my workspace for all the dirty stuff. Woodworking, milling, painting etc. So I store a lot of delicate equipment in there which seems to interest some people enough that they would like to own it as well.
I already built a custom lock for the metal gate to lock it 4-ways. For this I used a special lock mechanism from a small company named "Kotabau". They originate in Poland, but sell their products EU wide. As this lock takes a standard profile cylinder in contrast to the garage doors old round cylinder, I widened some holes and covered the old ones  with a 3D-printed front part.
For the bolds I cut some old 10mm axes from a 3D printer and printed guiding tubes for the pieces. The connection to the lock's latches were made from long aluminium angle pieces. The flat ones tend to bend when pushed on, so the angled pieces are way more sturdy in order to push the axis bolds through the door frame into holes in the wall frame.
The bolts to the sides are actually visible from the outside and therefore can be cut. But since they are hardened steel, one have to use an anglegrinder to get them cut in a few minutes. And then there are still two more at the top and bottom edges.
To protect the lock cylinder from attacks and also cover up the old mounting holes, I used a metal cover which provides protection against drilling and core pulling.
When you turn the outside handle while the lock is locked, you provide a force to the internal mechanism, so I changed the metal squareshaft with a 3D-printed, plastic one. It is plenty strong to retract the bolts while unlocked, but snaps if too much force is applied.
I use the same type of lock with my basement door, except here the bolts are 16mm threaded rods.

Nevertheless, some guys tried it anyways to open the garage without the proper key. They first tried overturning the handle and snapped the square shaft, just as planed. They then tried to pry open one edge of the metal gate, which was hampered by the side bolt. I assume, they lost interest then or it was to noisy to continue, so they aborted the break in.
I first was quite shocked about the damage when I discovered it the next morning. But then I realised that it could be fixed easily with some bending, a touch of paint and a new shaft.

After the repairs were done, I thought about improvements to the door security since I wanted to automate some stuff inside anyways.
